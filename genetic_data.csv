Next Steps:
Replace Placeholder Files:

Replace genetic_data.csv and linguistic_data.csv with actual datasets containing detailed genetic markers and linguistic features.
Enhance Integration Logic:

Extend the integrate_data function to perform actual data integration based on relevant criteria (e.g., matching ancestral markers with language families).
Advanced Analysis:

Use statistical or machine learning models to analyze correlations and dependencies between genetic and linguistic data.
